Apple Watch is a line of smartwatches produced by Apple Inc. It incorporates fitness tracking, health-oriented capabilities, and wireless telecommunication, and integrates with iOS and other Apple products and services.<br><br>

The Apple Watch was released in April 2015 and quickly became the best-selling wearable device: 4.2 million were sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, and more than 100 million people were estimated to use an Apple Watch as of December 2020.Apple has introduced new generations of the Apple Watch with improved internal components each September each labeled by Apple a 'Series', with certain exceptions.<br><br>

Each Series has been initially sold in multiple variants defined by the watch casing's material, color, and size (except for the budget watches Series 1 and SE, available only in aluminum), and beginning with Series 3, by the option in the aluminum variants for LTE cellular connectivity, which comes standard with the other materials.The band included with the watch can be selected from multiple options from Apple, and watch variants in aluminum co-branded with Nike and in stainless steel co-branded with Herm√®s are also offered, which include exclusive bands and digital watch faces carrying those companies' brandings.<br><br>

The Apple Watch operates primarily in conjunction with the user's iPhone for functions such as configuring the watch and syncing data with iPhone apps, but can separately connect to a Wi-Fi network for some data-reliant purposes, including basic communications and audio streaming.LTE-equipped models can independently connect to a mobile network, including for calling, texting, and installed mobile app data use, substantially reducing the need for an iPhone after initial setup.The oldest iPhone model that is compatible with any given Apple Watch depends on the version of system software installed on each device.As of September 2020, new Apple Watches come with watchOS 7 preinstalled and require an iPhone running iOS 14, which is available for the iPhone 6S and later.<br><br>
