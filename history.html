The history of watches began in 16th-century Europe, where watches evolved from portable spring-driven clocks, which first appeared in the 15th century.<br><br>

The watch was made by inventors and engineers developed from the 16th century to the mid-20th century was a mechanical device, powered by winding a mainspring which turned gears and then moved the hands; it kept time with a rotating balance wheel. In the 1960s the invention of the quartz watch which ran on electricity and kept time with a vibrating quartz crystal, proved a radical departure for the watchmaking industry. During the 1980s quartz watches took over the market from mechanical watches, a process referred to[by whom?] as the "quartz crisis". Although mechanical watches still sell at the high end of the watch market, the vast majority of watches as of 2020 have quartz movements.<br><br>

One account of the origin of the word "watch" suggests that it came from the Old English word woecce which meant "watchman", because town watchmen[when?] used watches to keep track of their shifts.[2][need quotation to verify] Another theory surmises that the term came from 17th-century sailors, who used the new mechanisms to time the length of their shipboard watches (duty shifts).<br><br>

The Oxford English Dictionary records the word watch in association with a timepiece from at least as early as 1542.<br><br>
